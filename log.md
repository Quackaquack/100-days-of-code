### Day 1: 7th of May, 2025
**Today's Progress:** Read through most of the introduction, making it to the part about the Linus terminal.

**Thoughts:** TOP is mind-numbingly boring until it gets to the Linux terminal part. Holy shit.

### Day 2: 8th of May, 2025
**Today's Progress:**
Completed the "Working With Files and Directories" part of Software Carpentry Foundation's Unix Shell course as part of the Foundations course by The Odin Project (TOP). Completed "Command Line Basics" lesson. Completed Setting Up Git. Completed Git basics.
THIS LINE WAS WRITTEN IN NANO ON MY LOCAL MACHINE.
Completed Git Basics. Completed Introduction to HTML and CSS.
Ended the day in the "Working with Text" lesson.

**Thoughts:** It was fun to do the Linux Shell excercises! Feels great to finally be back to something resembling code work. Software Carpentry Foundation might be worth looking into separately from The Odin Project. I would like to get better at using the terminal. TOP recomnmends https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial for more, so I might want to check that out at some point.
It's even more fun to move on to Git and HTML. Even though everything is still VERY simple, it feels wonderful to get back into actual coding, and learning.
It remains to be seen if I manage to stick with it, or if I end up abandoning the whole thing. But that doesn't bother me right now. Time will tell.

### Day 3: 9th of May, 2025
**Today's Progress**: Completed TOP up to and including the Lists lesson. Got started on Links and Images.

**Thoughts:** Went well. Not as much time to work as yesterday, but that's fine. Used pomodoro effectively today as well. Hung out in VC with Hjalte and Maria for a while, as a sort of body boubling.

### Day 4: 10th of May, 2025
**Today's Progress**: Very little. Added a dog.

**Thoughts:** VERY tired, so I am not going to code an hour today. But I'm still satisfied by the fact that I coded AT ALL. That's not nothing, not at all.
